# Wheel-Of-Development-HW4
As a devleoper I have been tasked to develop a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Such an assignment will familiarize myself with future coding assesments in industry, by creating a dynamically updated app with HTML and CSS powered via JavaScript, I can develop some experience in how quizes are operated and better prepare for future exams!

NB: The repo name pokes at the Wheel of Fortune quiz show! Just a quick fun fact if anyone was confused of its name!
